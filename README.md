# OOP-II (FAF-211 - Kalamaghin Arteom)
This is a quick summary about the work done. In the folders You can find
all the materials.

# Task I (Selected DS - Queue)
I've came up basic functionality and architecture that made it possible
to implement more advanced functionality from the end of the list. Also wrote
a makefile to compile and run patched snapshots faster.

# Task II (Tower of Hanoi - Stack)
Additionally (in case I lost any points on the last task and I have a chance
to win them back now), I created a working prototype of the game based
on the Tower of Hanoi problem. Each tower in this game is itself a stack, but
with some restrictions regarding the layout of the elements, so that with basic
operations on this data structure and input control, we can implement
the main mechanics of the game.

# Bonus
Just in case I've uploaded my solutions for the bonus probles we'he recieved
during seminars (preiskurant: 'Ladder' problem - 0.1 BP, 'Star' problem - 0.9 BP).
